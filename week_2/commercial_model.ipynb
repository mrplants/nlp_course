    "### What are we building\n",
    "We came a long way these past couple a weeks. We learned how to work with word vectors, decoder models, and now encoder models. Now, for our last project we want to encourage you try and implement some ideas you might have had when you joined this course, using one the latest models available via commercial API.  There are several models available, but we will focus on GPT-4-turbo, which is one of the most powerful models available today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "We will provide you some quick pointers to get you started with GPT-4 and the OpenAI Chat Completions API and also provide ideas that you might try to implement if you are not sure yet what you would like to try.\n",
