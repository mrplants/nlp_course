    "# Week 3: Embedding-Based Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we are building\n",
    "The goal of Embedding-Based Retrieval is to retrieve top-k candidates given a query based on embedding similarity/distance. A common application for this is given a query/sentence/document, find top-k similar candidates wrt query. While this is usually solved using TF-IDF/Information Retrieval (IR) based approaches, it is becoming more and more common in the industry to use an embedding based approach: encode the query and document as an embedding and use approximate nearest neighbor search to find top-k candidates in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a system to find duplicate questions on Quora using a [dataset released by Quora](https://quoradata.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs). A very common problem for forums/QA websites is trying to determine whether a question has already been asked before a user posts it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue to apply our learning philosophy of repetition as we build multiple models of increasing complexity in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieval based on WordVectors\n",
    "1. Using BERT\n",
    "1. Using Sentence BERT\n",
    "1. Using Cohere Sentence Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Evaluation\n",
    "We will evaluate our models along the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recall@k: the proportion of relevant items found in the top-k matches\n",
    "1. Mean Reciprocal Rank: the rank of the first relevant item with respect to the top-k.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have provided scaffolding for all the boilerplate FAISS code to get to our baseline model. This covers downloading and parsing the dataset, and training code for the baseline model. **Make sure to read all the steps and internalize what is happening**.\n",
    "1. At this point in our model, we will aim to use BERT embeddings. **Does this improve accuracy?**\n",
    "1. In the third model, we will use Sentence BERT and then we'll see if they can boost up our model. **How do you think this model will perform?**\n",
    "1. **Extension**: We have suggested a bunch of extensions to the project so go crazy! Tweak any parts of the pipeline, and see if you can beat all the current models.\n",
